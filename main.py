# BONUS EXERCISE - ERRORS ENCOUNTERED   
# This exercise is optional. The more errors you get familiar with, the better. That means you are adding to what you are learning from the lessons. "Practice makes perfect".
# Also, teachers will know the usual mistakes that beginner Python coders make and will be able to help more in that area.
# Before doing exercises 2 to 4 below, be aware of the errors that you encounter
# For each exercise below, list down some of the errors you saw (developers usually call this error "bug")
# What did you do to solve the error?
# NOTE: The more errors you get familiar with, the better. That means you are adding to what you are learning from the lessons. "Practice makes perfect".

# Exercise 2.) USING CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS (if, else, elif)
# Situation: Citizens apply for financial benefits from the government whose policy is to grant benefits to government employees for only 2 of his children. 
# A monthly allowance of 1.000Euro is given for each child if he/she is less than or equal to 20 years old.
# Write a set of codes using the conditional statements (if, else, elif) that checks the following conditions:
# If citizen's occupation is a government employee, check if he has kids eligible for benefits, calculate the total benefit amount
# If citizen's occupation is an entrepreneur, output the message "You make sure you pay your tax!"
# If citizen has other occupation, output the message "This facility is only for government employees!"
# At the end, output the message "Total benefit availed: " and total benefit amount
# (hint: Assign different values to the occupation of the citizen)

# Exercise 3.) APPLYING THE "for" LOOP 
# Have you watched Mary Poppins? I haven't, but there is a loooooong word that became popular from that movie.
# Let's do a bit of coding using the "for" loop
# Assign this loooooong word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" to a string variable
# For each letter in this looooooong word, print it
# Count the number of letters
# Print the number of letters at the end.

# Exercise 4.) APPLYING THE "while" LOOP
# Do you have a bicycle that has flat tyre. Imagine pumping up its tyre. Its inflation percentage is currently 20.
# Write a few codes that will do the following until the inflation percentage <100:
# Output "PUMP TYRE"
# Each time you pump the tyre, you add 10 to the inflation percentage
# Output "Tyre inflation percentage " and the new inflation percentage after you pumped some air
