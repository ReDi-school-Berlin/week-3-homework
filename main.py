# Exercise 1.)
# Create 3 variables:
# - Your favourite food
# - Your hobby
# - The current day
# Then print out a string that says something like:
# "Thursday was a good day, I ate pizza and played guitar" (hint: use the + operator)

# ------ ADD YOUR CODE BELOW: ------





# Exercise 2.)
# Let's do some math! Print the results of the following operations:
# - 59876 multiplied by 4359
# - 88659 divided by 5498
# - the remainder when you divide 867 by 23
# - 5 raised to the power of 89 (yes, Python can work with very large numbers!:))

# Exercise 3.)
# Practice VSCode! You will work in it a lot, so it's always good (of course this is something we cannot check here but we trust you:) )
# - Open a bunch of files
# - Open different workspaces
# - Create files and folders within VSCode
# - Watch this video on getting started with VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE&list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5UgiQnBfvD7XgOMKs3O_G6&index=1

# BONUS EXERCISE
# You don't have to do this if you don't want, just if you are up to the challenge
# Also, don't be surprised if it is a bit harder than the normal exercises, you might need to do some research on your own to solve it.

# Bonus 1.)
# Create a variable to store the value of pi and use it to print the following sentence:
# "The value of pi is 3.14" (hint: joining floats and strings is not as simple as two strings, but you could google it, for example "how to join a float and a string in python")
