## Exercises:

### Exercise 1.) Errors encountered Before doing exercises 2 to 4, be aware of the errors that you encounterUsing Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Before doing exercises 2 to 4, be aware of the errors that you encounter
- For each exercise below, list down some of the errors (Developers usually call it bug") you saw
- What did you do to solve the error? 
- NOTE: The more errors you get familiar with, the better. That means you are adding to what you are learning from the lessons. "Practice makes perfect".

### Exercise 2.) Using Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Situation: Citizens apply for financial benefits from the government whose policy is to grant government employee benefits for only 2 of his children, 1.000Euro for each child if he/she is less than or equal to 20 years old.
- Write a set of codes using the conditional statements (if, else, elif) that checks the following conditions:
- If citizen's occupation is a government employee, check if he has kids eligible for benefits, calculate the total benefit amount
- If citizen's occupation is an entrepreneur, output the message "You make sure you pay your tax!"
- If citizen has other occupation,  output the message "This facility is only for government employees!"
- At the end output the message "Total benefit availed: " and total benefit amount

_(hint: Assign different values to the occupation of the citizen)_

### Exercise 3.) Applying the "for" loop 
- Have you watched Mary Poppins? I haven't but there is a loooooong word that became popular from that movie.
- Let's do a bit of coding using the "for" loop
- Assign this loooooong word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" to a string variable
- For each letter in this looooooong word, print it
- Count the number of letters 
- Print the number of letters at the end.

### Exercise 4.) Applying the "while" loop 
- Do you have a bicycle that has flat tyre. Imagine pumping up its tyre. Its inflation percentage is currently 20. 
- Write a few codes that will do the following until the inflation percentage <100:
-   Output "PUMP TYRE" 
-   Each time you pump the tyre, you add 10 to the inflation percentage 
-   Output "Tyre inflation percentage " and the new inflation percentage after you pumped some air
