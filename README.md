# Homework for Week 2
_(Scroll down for some reminder on cloning this repository and making commits)_

## Exercises:

### Exercise 1.)
- Create 3 variables:
    - Your favourite food
    - Your hobby
    - The current day
- Then print out a string that says something like:  
   "Thursday was a good day, I ate pizza and played guitar"
   _(hint: use the + operator)_


### Exercise 2.) 
- Let's do some math! Print the results of the following operations:
    - 59876 multiplied by 4359
    - 88659 divided by 5498
    - the remainder when you divide 867 by 23
    - 5 raised to the power of 89 _(yes, Python can work with very large numbers!:))_

### Exercise 3.)
- Practice VSCode! You will work in it a lot, so it's always good (of course this is something we cannot check here but we trust you:) )
  - Open a bunch of files
  - Open different workspaces
  - Create files and folders within VSCode
  - [Watch this video on getting started with VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE&list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5UgiQnBfvD7XgOMKs3O_G6&index=1)


## BONUS EXERCISES
You don't have to do this if you don't want, just if you are up to the challenge  
Also, don't be surprised if it is a bit harder than the normal exercises, you might need to do some research on your own to solve it.

### Bonus 1.)
- Create a variable to store the value of pi and use it to print the following sentence:  
"The value of pi is 3.14"
_(hint: joining floats and strings is not as simple as two strings, but you could google it, for example "how to join a float and a string in python")_
